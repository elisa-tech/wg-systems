This description shows, how to get the parts, but will not provide them. This means, another systems can be used alternatively.

## BSP as a base
At the demo the BSP at <https://www.xilinx.com/member/forms/download/xef.html?filename=xilinx-zcu102-v2022.2-10141622.bsp> is used.
To get the file a valid AMD account is needed.

## Extract the BSP
The BSP file is a **tar.gz** file. So it can be extracted with

    tar xzf xilinx-zcu102-v2022.2-10141622.bsp # will be extracted to a directory xilinx-zcu102-2022.2
