# ELISA systems working group
The Systems WG aims to enable other working groups within ELISA to put their safety claims towards Linux in a wider system context. This is done in the form of a reproducible reference system based on real-world architectures, implemented fully based on Open-Source technologies. The Systems WG encourages interactions with other projects, which either also help enable safety use cases with Open-Source software or plan to make use of mixed-criticality system elements as a base for their product lines.
