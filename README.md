# ELISA systems working group
The Systems WG aims to enable other working groups within ELISA to put their safety claims towards Linux in a wider system context. This is done in the form of a reproducible reference system based on real-world architectures, implemented fully based on Open-Source technologies. The Systems WG encourages interactions with other projects, which either also help enable safety use cases with Open-Source software or plan to make use of mixed-criticality system elements as a base for their product lines.

The working group meets almost every week on Mondays (16:00 UTC, or during DST at 15:00 UTC).
- The meeting invitiation is send out via mailing list and can be depicted from the ELISA public meeting calendar.
- The minutes of meeting are kept within the repo wiki: https://github.com/elisa-tech/wg-systems/wiki#meetings

**We always welcome interested people and (potential) contributors.**
